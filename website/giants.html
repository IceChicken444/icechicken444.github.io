<p>
Gerald Dempsey "Buster" Posey[1] (born March 27, 1987), is an American professional baseball catcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball. He stands 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighs 215 pounds (98 kg). He bats and throws right-handed. Posey has also filled in at first base for the Giants.</p>

<p>Posey was born in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports in high school; when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. He attended Florida State University, where he began playing the catcher position. He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called back up to the major leagues in May. With the presence of then full-time catcher Bengie Molina, Posey played first base when originally called up to the majors, but became the Giants' regular catcher at the end of June when Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers, the team the Giants later faced in the World Series.</p>

<p>As a rookie, he finished with a .305 batting average, 18 home runs, and 67 runs batted in. He was named the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year. He caught every inning of the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. In 2011, Posey missed most of the year after he was severely injured in a collision with Scott Cousins at home plate.</p>

<p>Posey returned from his injury in 2012 and posted a .336 batting average to win the 2012 NL batting title. He became the second San Francisco Giant to win the batting title and was named the NL Most Valuable Player for 2012. He won his second World Series that year as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, Posey signed an eight-year contract extension worth $167 million, a record in sum and in length for a player with his level of experience.[2] He won his third World Series the following year as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals. In 2016, he won his first Gold Glove award after an excellent defensive season.</p>

<h2 id="madbum"> madison bumgarner </h2>

<p>Madison Kyle Bumgarner (born August 1, 1989), commonly known by his nickname, "MadBum",[1][2] is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). He stands 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall and weighs 250 pounds (110 kg). Bumgarner has won three World Series championships (2010, 2012, 2014) and two Silver Slugger Awards (2014, 2015). He has also been selected to four National League All-Star teams and is the Giants' strikeout leader by a left-handed pitcher in the San Francisco Era.[3]</p>

<p>Bumgarner played high school baseball at South Caldwell High School in Hudson, North Carolina, where he helped his team win the 2007 4A State Championship. After graduating, he was selected with the tenth overall pick in the 2007 MLB Draft by the San Francisco Giants. In his first year playing professionally, 2008, he won the South Atlantic League pitching triple crown. He and Buster Posey both made their Major League debuts in 2009, and they are considered one of the best batteries in Major League history based on their young age and early success in their careers. By throwing eight scoreless innings in Game 4 of the 2010 World Series, he became the youngest left-handed pitcher to accomplish the feat and helped win the franchise's first World Series in San Francisco and first since 1954.</p>

<p>Following one of the most dominant postseason and World Series pitching performances in modern MLB history, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2014 World Series, the 2014 Babe Ruth Award winner, the 2014 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, and the 2014 Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year.</p>
